# Command History (Command Recall)

Marix provides a **Command History** feature that stores and recalls previously executed commands for each server. This helps you quickly re-run common commands without typing them again.

## Command History Interface

## Features

- **Per-Server History**: Each server maintains its own command history
- **Local Storage Only**: Commands are stored locally, never synced or backed up
- **Sensitive Data Filtering**: Automatically filters out commands containing passwords, tokens, or secrets
- **LRU Pruning**: Automatically removes old commands (max 50 per server)
- **Execution Counter**: Tracks how many times each command has been used
- **Search**: Quickly filter commands with fuzzy search

## How to Enable

Command History is **disabled by default** for privacy. To enable:

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon in sidebar)
2. Navigate to **Terminal** section
3. Toggle **Enable Command Recall**

## Usage

### Opening Command History

When in a terminal session, press:
- **`Tab`** key when the terminal input is empty (cursor at empty line)

- Commands with `api_key` or `apikey`
- MySQL commands with `-p` flag (password)
- `sudo -S` (stdin password)
- Commands using `sshpass` or `expect` with password
- Environment variable exports with sensitive values

### Data Storage

- Stored in browser's `localStorage`
- **Never synced** to cloud services
- **Never included** in backups
- Cleared when you clear browser data

Commands containing sensitive patterns (passwords, tokens, etc.) are automatically filtered for security.

### Can I export my command history?

No, command history is intentionally local-only and not exportable for privacy reasons.

### Does command history sync between devices?

No, command history is stored locally and never synced.

### How do I disable command history?

Go to Settings → Terminal → Disable "Enable Command Recall". Existing history is preserved until you clear it manually.
