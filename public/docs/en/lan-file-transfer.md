## Troubleshooting

### Can't Find Sender/Receiver

1. Ensure both devices have **LAN Discovery ON** (🌐 icon active)
2. Both devices must be on the **same local network**
3. Check firewall isn't blocking Marix
4. Try refreshing the connection

### Transfer Fails

- Large files may take time - be patient
- Ensure stable network connection
- Try resending with a new pairing code
- Check available disk space on receiver

### Slow Transfer Speed

- Use wired Ethernet for faster transfers
- Reduce network congestion
- Close bandwidth-heavy applications
- Check router/network performance

## Security

- Transfers use **end-to-end encryption**
- 6-digit pairing code ensures only intended recipient receives files
- No data passes through external servers
- Files transfer directly between devices

## Tips

- **Large folders**: Select the folder instead of individual files
- **Multiple files**: You can select multiple items at once
- **Verify receipt**: Confirm with receiver that files arrived correctly
- **Network quality**: Better network = faster transfers
